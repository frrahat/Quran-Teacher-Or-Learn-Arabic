Changes
===========================
A significant change.
Full Ayah is displayed at the start with darker color. Animation with brighter color overwrites the previous. This will enable reading the text more comfortably.
 
Advanced settings are saved while closing, enabling comfortable control for the advanced users. Also, there is a new inclusion. Gaps between two consequtive words can be increased or decreased through the advanced setting.
