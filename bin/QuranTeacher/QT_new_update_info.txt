Changes
===========================
One significant change has been made.
Full Ayah is displayed at the start with darker color. Animation with brighter color overwrites the previous. This will enable reading the text more comfortably.
Other Changes: 
Advanced settings are saved while closing, enabling comfortable control for the advanced users. Also, there is a new inclusion. Gaps between two consequtive words can be increased or decreased through the advanced setting.
Also there are some changes of functioning in the Hit File Editor Dialog.

This update is optional for the user of version 1.2.0 and older.
Thank You for using this application.
